Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows enables operators to provision, operate, and manage Windows cells on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

After operators install the PAS for Windows tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, developers can push applications to Windows cells using the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/) (cf CLI).

For more information about how PAS for Windows works, see the [Product Architecture](architecture.html) topic.

For the PAS for Windows release notes, see the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) topic.
